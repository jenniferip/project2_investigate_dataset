# Jennifer Penuelas' Investigating a Dataset Project

This project explores Kaggle's Titanic dataset, using jupyter notebook. 

I have provided the notebook so that you can see all code and play with it yourself, however, you may read the report as a HTML page if the code does not interest you.

## Files

* `titanic-data.csv` - Titanic dataset, from Kaggle
* `titanic_data_analysis.html` - HTML report of the jupyter notebook
* `titanic_data_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook where all analysis was done
